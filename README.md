# Video wall prototype

This is a prototype of a video wall built with a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and the popular [Reveal presentation framework](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). It is based on the [Reveal plugin](https://developer.leapmotion.com/gallery/reveal-js-example-presentation) for the Leap Motion device.

It allows to browse through a video wall using gestures:
* Swipe a hand from right to left to move forward (or left to right or to go backwards)
* Swipe both hands to go to the beginning or the end of the presentation.
* Close your hand to see an overview of all the slides
